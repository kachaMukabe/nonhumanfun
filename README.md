# NonHumanFun

This is a fun holiday themed greeting app powered by A.I. 
This application uses A.I to generate a unique greeting card based on the starting sentence you choose.

Once you have a unique greeting record yourself reading the card for your significant other/parent/arch nemesis using the loom integration in the app.
This video can then be shared with your aforementioned ~arch nemesis~ friend/work colleague!
